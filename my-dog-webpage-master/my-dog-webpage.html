  <h1><em> My Life As a DOG</em></h1>

<body>
  <p> i love my life. you get fed, washed, taken for walks, cuddled. most of all, i love it because you get to bite people. and meet other dogs without restrictions.</p>

  <p> today i went for a walk in the park. i really loved the smell of grass. i got to sit down on a bench and enjoy the cool summer breeze.</p>

  <p> i dont think i will be posting any blogs any time soon because my human has cut down on cable. I heard him compaining that it is too expensive.</p>
